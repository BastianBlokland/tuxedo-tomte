Requires administrator privileges\&.
.RE
.PP
.SH "CONFIGURATION MODES"
.RS 4
Requires administrator privileges\&.
There are three configuration modes: AUTOMATIC/UPDATES_ONLY/DONT_CONFIGURE.
The modes are set by creating an empty file with the name of the configuration
mode in
.BR /etc/tomte/ \&
The file may be created manually as well\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBAUTOMATIC\fR
This is the default mode. Everything will be installed/updated/removed
automatically by Tomte\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBUPDATES_ONLY\fR
Only updates will be handled automatically by Tomte. No modules will be installed
or removed without user intervention\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBDONT_CONFIGURE\fR
Nothing will be configured by Tomte. Usefull if you want to create the file
before installing Tomte to avoid Tomte to make any unwanted changes to the
system or to set Tomte on hold after having the configuration you want\&.
.RE
.PP
.SH "TUXEDO FAI INSTALLATION"
.RS 4
Everything will be installed automatically. After a FAI installation, the
system should be ready to go. Fixes can be blocked afterwards if e.g. kernel
updates are not desired. If new fixes should be necessary, these will be
installed automatically\&.
.RE
.PP
.SH "INSTALLATION ON VANILLA SYSTEM"
.RS 4
Everything will be installed automatically, it might take a few minutes till
all is installed. Messages will appear on the desktop. Interrupting the
installation might damage the system\&.
If the files AUTOMATIC, UPDATES_ONLY or DONT_CONFIGURE are created in
/etc/tomte/ then the installation will act accordingly.
.RE
.PP
.SH "INSTALLATION WITHOUT MODIFICATIONS"
.RS 4
If creating a file /etc/tomte/DONT_CONFIGURE and installing Tomte afterwards,
Tomte will configure only the TUXEDO repositories and mirrors\&.
To find out which fixes are available to the system:
.br
      \fBtomte \fBlist\fP
.br

Then to install a required fix:
.br
      \fBtomte \fBconfigure \fIMODULE\fR
.RE
.PP
.SH "Typical workflow"
.RS 4
Just install Tomte, it will take care of all the fixes your sustem requires
and it also installs the TUXEDO kernel which brings all the required drivers\&.
If you don't want Tomte to make any modifications on your system or you want
to keep your specific kernel, you could create the file DONT_CONFIGURE in
.BR /etc/tomte \&
and Tomte will not make any modifications on the system, except for
the required repositories and Debian mirrors\&.
Afterwards you could list the required fixes with
.br
      \fBtomte \fBlist\fP
.br

block the fixes you don't want on your system with
.br
      \fBsudo \fBtomte \fBblock \fBMODULE\fP
.br

and set the Tomte installation mode to AUTOMATIC or UPDATES_ONLY with
.br
      \fBsudo \fBtomte \fBAUTOMATIC\fP
.br

or
.br
      \fBsudo \fBtomte \fBUPDATES_ONLY\fP
.br

Alternatively you could install the fixes you want manually by using
      \fBsudo \fBtomte \fBconfigure \fBMODULE\fP
