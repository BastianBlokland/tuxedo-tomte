as
.IP
\fBsudo touch /etc/tomte/AUTOMATIC\fP

Everything will be installed automatically, it might take a few minutes till

.SH "POSSIBLE WORKFLOW"
.RS 4
Just install
.B Tomte
, it will take care of all the fixes your system requires
and it also installs the
.B TUXEDO
kernel which brings all the required drivers\&.

If you don't want
.B Tomte
to make any modifications on your system or you want
to keep your specific kernel, you could create the file DONT_CONFIGURE in
.BR /etc/tomte \&
and
.B Tomte
will not make any modifications on the system, except for
the required repositories and Debian mirrors\&.
Afterwards you could list the required fixes with
.IP
      \fBtomte \fBlist\fP
.LP
block the fixes you don't want on your system with
.IP
      \fBsudo \fBtomte \fBblock \fIMODULE\fP
.LP
and set the
.B Tomte
installation mode to AUTOMATIC or UPDATES_ONLY with
.IP
      \fBsudo \fBtomte \fBAUTOMATIC\fP
.LP
or
.IP
      \fBsudo \fBtomte \fBUPDATES_ONLY\fP
.LP
Alternatively you could install the fixes you want manually by using:
.IP
      \fBsudo \fBtomte \fBconfigure \fIMODULE\fP
.LP
